# Family tree
> It's a prototype and can be extended to full project (in future)

### Features Present
1. Show the data in form of tree
2. Can add family member in the tree
3. All the data is saved in the browser (using "local storage")

## How to run project locally
```javascript
npm install //installs the dependencies (only required for the 1st time running the app)
```
```javascript
npm start //runs the app locally at port 3000
```


### Features Lack (Current thinking: basic features that can be added in near future)
---
1. Deleting the member from tree [EASY]
2. Adding independent member (not linked with any member) [MEDIUM]
3. Logic to find the relation ship between the two member (by using graph algorithm) [MEDIUM]
